# Backstreet Boys Reunion Tour to Backstreet Boys Reunion Tour

An extension that gives us some hope in humanity. Based on the running joke from Game Grumps.

[Firefox](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/covid-19-to-backstreet-boys/reviews/?score=2)

Chrome Instructions: 

So I'm in a slightly tight situation for money, so I can't pay their developer fee. To get around this, there is a .crx file in this repository. You can load it as unpacked for the time being.

## Credits

Like I mentioned before, this would not be possible without [Eric Bailey](https://github.com/ericwbailey) who put in actual effort and made the script I just edited for the goof. All praise goes to him. I'm just a college student who heard a meme and wanted to get a laugh.

To everyone who downloads/gets a laugh out of this, thank you for getting a laugh out of this stupid joke!.
